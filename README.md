# library-database-project

This is a library databse project that I worked on in the Fall 2022 semester. 
The website is built using PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MySQL. 
It contains many various features
- Adding/removing/editing books
- Library Checkouts
- Book Pagination
- Library Visualizations
- and much more!

Here are some screenshots of the project:
